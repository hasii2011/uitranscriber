pynput dynamically loads several modules module

To build my I followed the instructions at:

https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging.html

So my build line look like this:


python setup.py py2app --includes pynput.keyboard._darwin,pynput.mouse._darwin


As per the above page:

"If this is needed for a project on PyPI: Please file a bug on GitHub, that way we can teach py2app to do the right thing."

pynput is at:
